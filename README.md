### TODO 📝

- Load the cached content before actually processing to ensure that part 1 times are reflective of the time taken to
  perform the computation of the problem rather than reading the problem
- OCR for [2021 - 13 - part 2](/adventofcode.year2021/src/main/java/com/lewisbirks/adventofcode/day/Day13.java#L27)
